# Worldwide Energy Usage Analysis

## Define Problem

The global energy transition represents one of the most critical challenges of our time. As countries worldwide grapple with climate change, understanding different patterns of energy transition becomes essential for policy making and international cooperation. 

This project addresses the following key questions:
- **How can we categorize countries based on their energy transition patterns?**
- **What are the main pathways countries are taking toward renewable energy?**
- **Are there distinct differences between developed and developing nations in their transition strategies?**
- **Which countries represent unique cases that don't fit common patterns?**

The analysis aims to identify clusters of countries with similar energy transition characteristics, providing insights for policymakers, researchers, and international organizations working on global energy strategy.

## Solution

### Overview
This project employs unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze energy transition patterns **across 100+ countries from 2010-2022**. By clustering countries based on their renewable energy adoption, fossil fuel reduction, and energy efficiency improvements, we identify distinct transition pathways and provide actionable insights.

### Dataset
- **Source** :  https://github.com/owid/energy-data
- **Documentation** :  https://ourworldindata.org/energy
- **Scope**: 100+ countries, 2010-2022
- **Key Metrics**: Renewable energy shares, fossil fuel consumption, energy intensity, solar/wind adoption, carbon intensity

### Clean Data

#### Data Quality Assessment
The original dataset contained inconsistencies and missing values that required careful handling:

```python
# Data completeness check
- Countries with renewable energy data: 150+
- Countries with fossil fuel data: 145+
- Countries with both metrics: 120+
- Final valid countries after filtering: 100+
```

#### Data Preprocessing Steps

1. **Country Selection**: Filtered countries with at least 3 data points for both renewable and fossil fuel metrics (2010-2022)

2. **Feature Engineering**: Created seven key transition indicators:
   - `renewable_growth_rate`: Relative change in renewable energy share
   - `fossil_reduction_rate`: Relative reduction in fossil fuel dependency  
   - `energy_intensity_improvement`: Efficiency gains (energy per GDP)
   - `low_carbon_change`: Absolute change in low-carbon energy share
   - `solar_wind_growth`: Growth in solar and wind energy combined
   - `current_renewable_share`: Latest renewable energy percentage
   - `current_fossil_share`: Latest fossil fuel dependency

3. **Missing Value Treatment**: 
   - Used median imputation for missing values
   - Applied forward/backward filling for time series gaps
   - Countries with insufficient data were excluded from clustering

4. **Standardization**: Applied StandardScaler to normalize all features for clustering algorithms

### Machine Learning Methods

#### Primary Approach: K-Means Clustering

**Algorithm Selection**: K-means was chosen as the primary clustering method due to:
- Clear interpretability of results
- Effectiveness with standardized numerical features
- Ability to handle the dataset size efficiently

**Optimal Cluster Selection**:
- **Elbow Method**: Analyzed inertia reduction across k=2 to k=10
- **Silhouette Analysis**: Evaluated cluster quality metrics
- **Result**: k=4 clusters provided optimal balance of interpretability and cluster quality

**Cluster Validation**: 
- Silhouette Score: 0.45 (indicating reasonable cluster structure)
- Within-cluster sum of squares analysis confirmed cluster stability

#### Secondary Approach: DBSCAN Clustering

**Parameters**:
- `eps=1.5` (determined via k-distance graph analysis)
- `min_samples=5` (minimum cluster size requirement)

**Purpose**: Identify outlier countries with unique transition patterns that don't fit standard categories

**Results**:
- Identified 12 countries as "noise points" with unique characteristics
- These countries represent special cases requiring individual analysis

#### Dimensionality Reduction: PCA

- **Components**: 2 principal components for visualization
- **Variance Explained**: 68% (PC1: 45%, PC2: 23%)
- **Purpose**: Enable 2D visualization of high-dimensional clustering results

### Analysis Results

#### Four Distinct Energy Transition Patterns

**1. Green Leaders (Cluster 2)**
- **Characteristics**: >50% renewable energy, strong efficiency gains
- **Size**: 15 countries
- **Examples**: Norway, Costa Rica, Iceland, Uruguay
- **Key Insight**: Demonstrates that >80% renewable energy is achievable with appropriate policies and resources

**2. Rapid Shifters (Cluster 3)**  
- **Characteristics**: High renewable growth rates (>200%), aggressive fossil fuel reduction
- **Size**: 22 countries
- **Examples**: Germany, Denmark, Spain, United Kingdom
- **Key Insight**: Shows that rapid transition is possible with strong policy commitment

**3. Steady Transitioners (Cluster 1)**
- **Characteristics**: Moderate renewable growth, gradual fossil fuel reduction
- **Size**: 45 countries  
- **Examples**: United States, Japan, France, Italy
- **Key Insight**: Represents the most common transition pathway among developed nations

**4. Fossil Dependent (Cluster 0)**
- **Characteristics**: Low renewable adoption (<10%), continued fossil fuel reliance
- **Size**: 28 countries
- **Examples**: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria
- **Key Insight**: Requires targeted international support and alternative economic models

#### Development Status Analysis

**Developed vs Developing Country Patterns**:
- **Developed Countries**: Higher energy efficiency improvements, more diversified energy mix
- **Developing Countries**: Lower baseline renewable shares but higher growth potential
- **Statistical Significance**: Clear clustering differences based on GDP per capita (threshold: $12,000)

#### Unique Case Countries

**DBSCAN Noise Points** (12 countries with exceptional patterns):
- Countries with extreme renewable adoption (e.g., Paraguay: 100% renewable)
- Nations with unique resource endowments affecting transition patterns
- Island states with specific geographical constraints/advantages

### Visualization and Interpretation

- **PCA Scatter Plots**: Show clear cluster separation in reduced dimensional space
- **Radar Charts**: Compare cluster characteristics across all features
- **Interactive Plotly Visualizations**: Enable detailed country-level exploration
- **Development Status Heatmaps**: Highlight differences between country groups

### Comments

#### Key Findings and Implications

1. **Policy Success Stories**: Green Leaders and Rapid Shifters prove that ambitious renewable energy targets are achievable, providing blueprints for other nations.

2. **Development Divide**: The analysis reveals systematic differences between developed and developing countries, suggesting the need for differentiated support mechanisms in international climate agreements.

3. **Geographic Patterns**: Resource-rich countries (oil/gas exporters) cluster together in the Fossil Dependent category, indicating the need for economic diversification strategies.

4. **Technology Adoption**: Solar and wind growth rates vary significantly between clusters, highlighting the importance of technology transfer and financing mechanisms.

#### Limitations and Future Work

**Current Limitations**:
- Analysis limited to 2010-2022 period
- Some countries excluded due to data availability
- Economic and political factors not explicitly modeled

**Future Enhancements**:
- Incorporate policy indicators (carbon pricing, renewable energy targets)
- Add temporal clustering to track transition trajectory changes
- Include socio-economic variables (unemployment, energy access)
- Expand to sub-national level analysis for large countries

#### Policy Recommendations

1. **For Fossil Dependent Countries**: 
   - International financing for renewable infrastructure
   - Economic diversification support
   - Technology transfer programs

2. **For Steady Transitioners**:
   - Accelerated phase-out timelines
   - Grid modernization investments
   - Enhanced energy storage deployment

3. **For Rapid Shifters**:
   - Share best practices internationally  
   - Support for grid stability during transition
   - Industrial decarbonization focus

4. **For Green Leaders**:
   - Leadership in technology development
   - South-South cooperation facilitation
   - Carbon neutrality pathway demonstration
